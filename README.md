## Game Design

### Story Modes

Each playthrough generates a story with:
- A protagonist (the player)
- An antagonist (the goal)
- Multiple locations connected by meaningful routes
- Quest objectives and progression

Genres available:
- **Fantasy**: Dragons, magic, quests, curses
- **Sci-Fi**: Space stations, AI, alien worlds, technology
- **Detective**: Crime scenes, clues, suspects, investigations
- **Horror**: Haunted locations, creatures, supernatural events

### Map Design

The world is built with:
- **Locations**: Each location has a description that varies based on visit status
- **Transitions**: Routes between locations with different types (normal, enter, teleport, one-way)
- **Items**: Found scattered throughout the world
- **NPCs**: Characters to interact with for information and rewards

### Combat

Combat is tactical:
1. **Attack**: Deal damage to enemy (damage = weapon bonus ± variance)
2. **Defend**: Reduce damage taken this round
3. **Heal**: Use a healing item (takes action, doesn't attack)
4. **Flee**: Attempt to escape (60% success rate)

Damage calculation:
```
damage_dealt = base_damage - enemy_armor + random_variance
```
